## 🧪 Example Usage

### Flask API

**Sample curl:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/dm -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"input": "The party enters the tavern."}' --output response.mp3
```

#### `/api/generate`

Use this endpoint when you only need the raw text from the AI without TTS.
The body accepts a JSON payload with:

* `prompt` - the player's input or narration seed
* `action_type` - how to treat the prompt (`do`, `say`, `story`, `continue`)
    * `do` - describe a player action
    * `say` - lines of in-character speech
    * `story` - force narrative exposition
    * `continue` - keep narrating from the last response
* `genre` *(optional)* - e.g. `sci-fi`, `horror`, `fantasy`
* `context` *(optional)* - array of prior messages for additional history

**Sample curl:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "prompt": "Open the ancient door",
        "action_type": "do",
        "genre": "fantasy",
        "context": ["The hallway is dark and cold."]
      }'
```
The response contains JSON with a `text` field describing the next part of the story.

### Discord
- Invite your bot to your server.
- Use `/new_campaign [prompt]` in a voice channel to start a campaign and set turn order.
- The bot will announce the first player and prompt them to act.
- The current player uses `/act <action>` to take their turn (AI narrates and speaks as before).
- Narration now ends with 2-3 suggested actions to keep the story moving.
- When finished, the player uses `/end_turn` to pass to the next player (announced in text and voice).
- If you try to act out of turn, the bot will remind you to wait.
- Check your current location: `/whereami`
- Debug the channel state: `/campaignstate` (ephemeral)
- Recap recent events: `/recap`
- Adjust difficulty: `/set-difficulty <easy|normal|hard>` (admin only)
- The bot manages voice connections per server, so multiple guilds can play simultaneously without issues.

## 📝 Character Sheets (Player Stats & Inventory)

- Register your character: `/register <character_name>`
- View your stats: `/mystats`
- Set a stat: `/setstat <stat> <value>` (e.g. `/setstat STR 15`)
- Add to inventory: `/inventory add "Item Name"`
- Remove from inventory: `/inventory remove "Item"`
- View inventory: `/inventory view`
- Character data is stored per Discord user in `/characters/` as JSON files.

### 🌐 Web Portal

When `python app.py` is running, open `http://localhost:5000/portal/` to browse all
registered characters, edit them and view campaign summaries. The portal now shows
combat history and includes a simple DM dashboard for NPC management.

---

## 📜 Session Logging & Export

- All narration and player messages are logged per session/channel in `/logs/` as Markdown files.
- Log format: `[timestamp] **Speaker:** message`
- Export your session log: `/exportlog` (zips and sends the Markdown log file)

---

## 🎲 Dice Rolling

- Roll dice: `/roll <dice>` (e.g. `/roll 2d6+1`, `/roll 1d20`)
- Skill check: `/roll athletics` (uses your STR mod, supports --adv/--disadv)
- Saving throw: `/save WIS vs 14`
- The bot will also auto-roll if the AI says e.g. "Roll a 1d20" in its response.
- Dice results are shown in chat and logged.
- Dice rolls can use character stats and proficiency.
- Supports advantage/disadvantage.
- Rolls feed into AI for narrative outcomes.

---

## 🗣️ Adding New Voices

Create a `voice_profiles.json` file in the project root based on
`voice_profiles.json.example`:

```json
{
  "Narrator": "your-elevenlabs-voice-id",
  "Grumpy Dwarf": "..."
}
```

Use `/setvoice` (coming soon) or edit this file to map character tags to voice
IDs. The bot loads this file at runtime so you can swap voices without touching
the code.

---

## 🏰 Starting a New Adventure (Slash Command)

- Use `/start_adventure [prompt]` to generate a new campaign setup (title, setting, plot hook) using GPT-4o.
    - You can provide a prompt for inspiration, e.g. `/start_adventure pirates in a flying whale fortress`.
    - If no prompt is given, a default adventure is generated.
- The campaign is saved in the per-channel state and shown in chat.
- If you are in a voice channel, the campaign intro will be read aloud using ElevenLabs TTS (Narrator voice).

---

## 🕹️ Gameplay Loop

1. Start a campaign with `/new_campaign` or `/start_adventure`.
2. The bot announces the turn order and prompts the first player.
3. On your turn, describe your action with `/act <action>`.
4. Inline dice like `[1d20+2]` are rolled automatically when you `/act`.
5. If a roll is required by the DM, use `/roll` or `/save`.
6. Finish your turn with `/end_turn` (or enable `/set_auto_advance true`).
7. Acting out of turn triggers a reminder to wait.
8. Admins can reset a session with `/reset-campaign` or force the turn with `/force-turn <user>`.

---

## 🗃️ State Persistence
- Game state is saved per session (API) or per Discord channel (bot) in the `state/` folder as JSON.
- Each channel stores its campaign title, realm, plot hook, current location, player list and recent prompt history.
- You can delete these files to reset a session.

---

## 🔒 Security
- Never commit your real `.env` file or API keys.

---

## 🛠️ Extending
- Add Whisper for STT, dice mechanics, or a web frontend by creating new modules in `services/` or `utils/`.
