PLAYING D&D 5E WITH THE AI DM DISCORD BOT
========================================

Welcome to your AI-powered D&D 5e experience! This bot enables turn-based, voice-enhanced adventures with GPT narration, dice validation, and robust state management. Here’s how to play:

---
GETTING STARTED
---------------
1. **Register Your Character**
   - Use `!register <character name>` to create your character.
   - Set stats with `!setstat <stat> <value>` (e.g., `!setstat STR 16`).
   - Add items with `!inventory add "Item Name"`.

2. **Start a Campaign**
   - Join a voice channel with all players.
   - One player runs `/start-campaign` (optionally add a prompt for the adventure).
   - The bot sets the turn order and introduces the campaign.

---
GAMEPLAY LOOP
-------------
- The game is turn-based. Only the current player may act.
- On your turn, use `/act <action>` to describe what your character does.
- The AI DM narrates the result. If a roll is needed, you’ll be prompted (e.g., “You must now /roll your DEX check.”).
- Roll the appropriate dice in real life, then use `/roll <result>` (e.g., `/roll 17`). The bot validates the roll and continues the story.
- When finished, use `/end_turn` to pass to the next player.

---
ADMIN COMMANDS
--------------
- `/reset-campaign` — Reset the campaign for the channel (admin only).
- `/force-turn <user>` — Force the turn to a specific player (admin only).

---

1. **Setup:**
   - Both join a voice channel.
   - Alice: `/start-campaign` (bot introduces the adventure, sets turn order)
   - Bot: “Alice, it’s your turn. What do you do?”

2. **Turn 1 (Alice):**
   - Alice: `/act I search the old chest for traps.`
   - Bot: “You approach the chest. Please roll your Investigation check.”
   - Alice: (rolls a d20, gets 15) `/roll 15`
   - Bot: “You find a hidden needle trap and disarm it. What do you do next?”
   - Alice: `/end_turn`

3. **Turn 2 (Bob):**
   - Bot: “Bob, it’s your turn. What do you do?”
   - Bob: `/act I open the chest.”
   - Bot: “Inside, you find a mysterious amulet. What do you do next?”
   - Bob: `/end_turn`

4. **Repeat:**
   - The loop continues, alternating turns, with the AI DM narrating and requesting rolls as needed.
