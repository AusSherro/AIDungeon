# AI Dungeon Master Game Instructions

## Example Workflow: 2 Players and Narrator

### Setup
1. Both players join the Discord server and register their characters:
   - `/register Alice`
   - `/register Bob`
2. The DM (AI) starts a new campaign:
   - `/start_adventure A haunted forest mystery`
3. The bot announces the campaign intro and sets the turn order:
   - `/new_campaign [prompt]` (if not already set)

### Turn Order
- The bot announces: "Turn order: Alice, Bob"
- The bot: "Alice, it's your turn!"

### Player Turn Example
**Alice:** `/act I cautiously enter the forest, looking for clues.`
- The AI narrates the outcome, e.g.:
  - `[Voice: Narrator] The trees close in around you, their branches creaking...`
  - If a skill check is needed: `[Voice: Narrator] Roll a Perception check!`
- Alice rolls: `/roll 1d20+WIS`
- The bot calculates using Alice's WIS modifier and returns the result.
- The AI continues narration based on the roll.

**End of Turn:**
- Alice: `/end_turn`
- The bot: "Bob, it's your turn!"

**Bob:** `/act I draw my sword and prepare to defend Alice.`
- The AI narrates, possibly triggering combat.

### Combat Example
- The bot starts combat: `/start_combat`
- Initiative is rolled for all combatants.
- The bot announces turn order and HP/AC for each.
- On each turn, the player can attack, cast spells, or use abilities.
- The bot resolves attacks using stats, AC, and HP.
- Incapacitated combatants are skipped automatically.

### Quality of Life
- `/recap` for a summary of the story so far
- `/npc <name>` to get info on an NPC
- `/location` for a description of the current area
- Auto-save and undo/rewind are available if mistakes are made

Enjoy your adventure! The AI DM will keep the story immersive and rules-faithful.
